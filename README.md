### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2021

+ Projec title: Replacement of God in Philosophy
+ This project is conducted by Noah Love

+ Project summary: This project is an exploration of the use of god as an explanation tool in philosophical texts over the last four centuries. It represents a display the the gradual decline in god and heavenly terms in philosophy which may have helped shift the use of class and group speech.
